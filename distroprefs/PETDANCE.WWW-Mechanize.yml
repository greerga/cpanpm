  If test dies before $pid404 is set, Perl's kill is called with undef (=0 to OS)
  and kills entire process group (i.e., the smoker)

  very nasty behaviour during test. Once had to kill the screen
  terminal afterwards, cannot ^C in general. Might have success to get
  it back to life by trying to scroll? Not really fond of retrying.

match:
  distribution: "^PETDANCE/WWW-Mechanize-1.34"
  perlconfig:
    version: '^5\.6\.2'
disabled: 1
